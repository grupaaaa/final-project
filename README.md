## About us
Hello, we are group of four girls which finishing Python from basic course in SDA Programing School. 
We decided to write some code with django to create an online store.



## To run a project

If you want to run this project yourself, you need to install git and some python interpreter like Pycharm on your computer and follow these steps
* in git: git  clone https://github.com/grupaaaa/final-project.git
* open project in PyCharm and create venv for it
* create .env file in next to env.example.txt in finalProject file and copy his context to new file
* at PyCharm go to the path \final-project\finalProject\ and in terminal run a coment "pip install requirements.txt"
* in the same path in terminal run a "python manage.py migrations" to create your database

Now you can check that server is working. In terminal go to path \final-project\finalProject\ and run a coment "python manage.py runserver"
